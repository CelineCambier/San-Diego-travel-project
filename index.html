                    <h3>San Diego, the Amercia's Finest City </h3>
                    <p>Back in the early 1970s the slogan "America's Finest City" was 
                        coined for San Diego as part of advertising drive to attract 
                        visitors to the city. The nickname has stuck ever since, it's 
                        our slogan. With origins in the rejection of our small city, 
                        it became a rallying cry to celebrate who we are, boost our 
                        civic pride, and recognize our potential.</p>
                    <p>This SoCal metropolis offers more than just temperate year-round 
                        weather. There are plenty of pristine beaches, a vibrant arts 
                        scene, a diversity of cultures and a rich military history that 
                        lend San Diego its distinct charm</p>
